## My process

Started with the HTML5 structure adding the favicon and the Qr image from the zip file.
Continued with the CSS styling:
-At first defining the variables from the styling guide (also from the zip file).
-Shortly after, resizing the container (".card") and the text elements.
-Decided to use flexbox for centering the content.
-Then adding the respective colors.
-Finally adding the media queries for responsiveness and refactoring the CSS styling.
